# Udacity Full Stack NanoDegree Project1: Movie Trailer Website
## project summary:
This is the source code for my first project in the Udacity Full Stack 
nanodegree.
The Project is to improve upon the source code found in
 [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode), provided by
 Udacity, to create a fully functioning program to create a movie trailer
  website.
<br><br>This webpage the program generates will contain the youtube 
trailers for the movie, the movie's poster, and the name of the movie.
## Usage:
The program is designed to run in python 2.7.15 which can be downloaded
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/).
No additional external libraries are needed to run this program.
<br><br>
Either download the repository or use git to clone the repo using the following
console command:
<br>
> git clone https://github.com/tpoff/ud036_StarterCode.git

<br>To run the program simply open entertainment_center.py in idle and run the 
script.<br><br>
Additionally, you could run the program on the command line by running the 
following command.
<br>

> python entertainment_center.py

<br>
The program will automatically generate an html file for the movie webpage
and open it in the default webbrowser for the system. 
<br><br>To add new movies to the webpage edit entertainment_center.py
detailed instructions and examples for movie entries in the code itself
